C., where they had been in storage. The increments that were sent to the Records Center were reassembled to create the file that would have existed had all the records remained in Ullman’s office. Thus the files, as near as possible, are arranged chronologically within each heading. The headings differ, however, because a new filing system was adopted in 1969. As a result, materials that were filed under one heading between 1957 and 1968, are found under a different, more specific, heading after that period. A researcher interested in a particular subject may need to consult several files to be certain of finding everything relating to the topic.\\n\\nThe Papers are organized into eight series, each also described separately in the box by box inventory. Series I covers material from 1957 through 1968 and consists of general subject files. The inventory lists the types of materials included under each heading as well as specific topics that are covered. An office index to this series can be found in Box 1.\\n\\nSeries II through IV contain files generated between 1969 and 1980, inclusive. This begins the new filing system so that although this material is also filed according to subject, the headings are more specific; that is, naming the departments (Series II), agencies (Series III), and House Committees (Series IV). For example, material files under Natural Resources in Series I are included under the Department of the Interior in Series II. Series V through Series VII cover the entire twenty-four years of Ullman’s career and contain specific material relating to individual bills (primarily those introduced by Ullman, Series V), Oregon projects and affairs (Series VI), and publicity and scheduling (Series VII). Series VIII, contains carbons of Ullman’s outgoing correspondence, referred to as “whites.” These can also be used as a cross-reference index to the correspondence in the files arranged by subject, as notations of other file headings appear in the upper right-hand corner of the “white.” Series IX contains several hundred images, primarily official portraits and scenes of Ullman representing his constituents, 1957 to 1981.\\n\\nIndividual case files have been disposed of in accordance with Mr. Ullman’s wishes.\\n\\n", "publish"=>true}], "publish"=>true}, {"jsonmodel_type"=>"note_multipart", "persistent_id"=>"e9337cc09654ec0dd22ed3bd2724c5be", "type"=>"arrangement", "subnotes"=>[{"jsonmodel_type"=>"note_text", "content"=>"Collection is organized into the following series:\\n\\nSeries I.

S. House of Representatives. The collection covers all the issues which concerned Ullman and his constituents between 1957 and 1981.\\n\\nThe Ullman Papers came to the University of Oregon in 1981 from the Federal Records Center in Washington, D. C., where they had been in storage. The increments that were sent to the Records Center were reassembled to create the file that would have existed had all the records remained in Ullman’s office. Thus the files, as near as possible, are arranged chronologically within each heading. The headings differ, however, because a new filing system was adopted in 1969. As a result, materials that were filed under one heading between 1957 and 1968, are found under a different, more specific, heading after that period. A researcher interested in a particular subject may need to consult several files to be certain of finding everything relating to the topic.\\n\\nThe Papers are organized into eight series, each also described separately in the box by box inventory. Series I covers material from 1957 through 1968 and consists of general subject files. The inventory lists the types of materials included under each heading as well as specific topics that are covered. An office index to this series can be found in Box 1.\\n\\nSeries II through IV contain files generated between 1969 and 1980, inclusive. This begins the new filing system so that although this material is also filed according to subject, the headings are more specific; that is, naming the departments (Series II), agencies (Series III), and House Committees (Series IV). For example, material files under Natural Resources in Series I are included under the Department of the Interior in Series II. Series V through Series VII cover the entire twenty-four years of Ullman’s career and contain specific material relating to individual bills (primarily those introduced by Ullman, Series V), Oregon projects and affairs (Series VI), and publicity and scheduling (Series VII). Series VIII, contains carbons of Ullman’s outgoing correspondence, referred to as “whites.” These can also be used as a cross-reference index to the correspondence in the files arranged by subject, as notations of other file headings appear in the upper right-hand corner of the “white.” Series IX contains several hundred images, primarily official portraits and scenes of Ullman representing his constituents, 1957 to 1981.\\n\\nIndividual case files have been disposed of in accordance with Mr. Ullman’s wishes.\\n\\n", "publish"=>true}], "publish"=>true}, {"jsonmodel_type"=>"note_multipart", "persistent_id"=>"e9337cc09654ec0dd22ed3bd2724c5be", "type"=>"arrangement", "subnotes"=>[{"jsonmodel_type"=>"note_text", "content"=>"Collection is organized into the following series:\\n\\nSeries I.
