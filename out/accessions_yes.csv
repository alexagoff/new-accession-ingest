These might have come from Vicky Jones' office--just not sure.

I got this box from Marilyn Reaves, I think when she retired. I looked through the box and it is various items that will go into existing collections. I put some sticky-notes on some of the folders indicating collections, but that was just a quick pass-through. It appears to be a hodge-podge of material. I'm sorry I don't know more about provenance. Sort of related: I did have some individual manuscript material that resulted from a purge of the donor files to rid them of actual collection material; these materials had been stored with Marilyn in record storage boxes as well but came to me at her retirement. I went through that material during the initial pandemic period to determine placement.
